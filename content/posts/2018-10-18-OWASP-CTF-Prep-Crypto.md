# So you found the info.....

... your reward is some extra info on the challenge. This one is Lockpicking. The main device that I have been teasing people with was built by me, but it is at the heart a lockpicking challenge.

The challenge itself uses a arduino nano, a OLED display, and shutter key switch and a few other supporting pieces.

So, since some people asked, I have decided to post a bit of information about how the device was built.
